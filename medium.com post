Project - CNN for Image Classification
Introduction
Image classification is one of the most prominent applications of deep learning in computer vision. In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow with Keras. This post outlines the purpose, dataset, model architecture, results, and conclusions of the project.
Purpose of the Project
The objective of this project is to:
Train a machine learning model to classify cats and dogs from images.
Apply deep learning concepts such as convolution, pooling, and dense layers.
Evaluate the model's performance and test its prediction on unseen images.

The project is ideal for beginners looking to understand how to use CNNs for binary image classification tasks.

Machine Learning Model

I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following structure:
Convolutional Layers:

Extract spatial features using filters (3x3 kernel size).
Use ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity.

MaxPooling Layers:

Reduce spatial dimensions while retaining important features.

Fully Connected Layers:

Dense layer with 128 neurons.
Dropout Layer: Helps prevent overfitting.
Final sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Results

I trained the model for 25 epochs using the training set and validated it on the test set. After training:
Accuracy: The model achieved significant accuracy for classifying unseen cat and dog images.
Loss: The training and validation loss steadily decreased.

Testing Predictions
Here's a snapshot of predictions for images in the single_prediction folder:

Image2.jpg → Cat

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of Convolutional Neural Networks in solving image classification problems. The key takeaways include:
Preprocessing images using ImageDataGenerator is essential for feeding data into CNNs.
Using dropout layers helps in reducing overfitting.
A relatively simple CNN architecture can achieve impressive results for binary classification tasks.

For anyone exploring deep learning or starting with image classification, this project serves as a foundational example of building and training a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras.
